According to Wohler's report of 2019, the metal additive manufacturing industry has shown record growth with an increase of 41.9 % [1). The reported growth indicates that the AM industry has significant potential in patient-specific medical implants, lightweight components for the aerospace and automotive sector, which eventually reduced fuel consumption. However, the process repeatability",The global metal additive manufacturing (AM) market is expected to grow at a significant rate during the forecast period.
11,"and reliability remain a significant concern in AM [2]. Therefore, the need for implementing in-situ or real- time monitoring sensors is inevitable. Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) also, commonly known as selective laser melting (SLM) or direct laser melt sintering (DMLS), is one of the many additive manufacturing techniques. L-PBF uses the metal powder material deposited in a layer by layer fashion to create a 3-Dimensional (3-D) model from a digital",Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is one of the many additive manufacturing techniques.
12,"computer-aided design (CAD) design. After each powder recoating layer, the laser fuses the metal powder material selectively fort that specific layer; afterward, the next new layer of powder is uniformly distributed by the recoater. The process repeats until the whole 3D model is manufactured. The total manufacturing time can vary from hours to days, based on the part's geometrical features. Despite tremendous technological advancements in developing the latest commercial L-PBF systems, the process reliability",Laser Beam Melting (L-PBF) is a 3D printing process that uses a laser beam to melt metal.
13,"and repeatability still need to materialize. Thus, the L-PBF process has many input parameters that can significantly influence the part's overall quality [3-5]. For instance, Van Elsen has listed at least 50 parameters that can affect the final part quality [6]. The expensive and time-consuming non-destructive techniques (NDT) such as computer tomography (CT) is used to check the overall part health and quantify the defects [6]. Therefore, to improve the comprehensive quality assurance and monitor the process in",This study aims to improve the comprehensive quality assurance and monitor the process through the use of non-destructive techniques to check the overall part health and quantify the defects.
14,"real-time, active research is directed on using in-situ sensors based on real-time monitoring, data analytics, and process control. The overall thrust has been developing the models with hardware and data analytics techniques to isolate the type, location, and severity of the defects in real-time [7). The final aim can be achieved by developing a closed feedback control loop to mitigate these defects inline. In the literature, different means of measurement, such as infrared thermography, pyrometry, optical",The aim of this research project is to develop real-time models to monitor and mitigate the defects in the production line.
15,"spectroscopy, ultrasonic sensors, etc., are reported to monitor the L-PBF process [8]. Considering the subject's vast scope, we focus mainly on reviewing the recent development in fault detection in the L-PBF process using machine learning based on sensors' responses. A large scale of data being generated with an increase in the number of sensors used to monitor the process. An extensive set of data also poses a significant challenge related to storage and post-processing.","In recent years, sensors have been used to monitor the low-pressure, low-temperature (L-PBF) process in the oil and gas industry."
16,"Machine learning (ML) is an alternative way to cope with the challenges mentioned above. Furthermore, ML can post-process the data in real-time. Many powerful and sophisticated ML models have been developed with advanced hardware in the last decade, capable of identifying complex non-linear relationships from massive data [9-12]. Ideally, ML approaches can be divided into three subgroups: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Supervised ML requires a labeled dataset to","Large amounts of data need to be processed quickly, large amounts of data need to be analysed, and large amounts of data need to be stored."
17,"train the specific model. In other words, each training datapoint has a label, e.g., ""good"" and ""bad,"" and users must know the ground truth of the training dataset before learning. In many applications such as AM, sometimes, it is a very costly and laborious task to understand the data points' labels. Whereas in the unsupervised ML approach, there is no prior requirement of the labels for the training dataset. The algorithm tries to find a pattern based on some relationships among the dataset. As the name suggests,","In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm, which is able to train a specific model without the need for labels in the training dataset."
18,"the semi-supervised learning approach uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches at the same time. In other words, it requires both labeled and unlabeled datasets. This approach can be helpful where obtaining the ground truth dataset is a very challenging task [13-16].

Recoater-Streaking is the most common anomaly that occurs due to damage to the silicone lip due to part-hopping (Fig. 5. (b)). Another critical anomaly called ""incomplete spreading"" or ""Uneven Powder Spreading"" can also be captured by pre- exposure images (Fig. 5. (c)).

82,"5.3. Melt Pool Monitoring Anomalies As explained in section 2.3, the melt pool monitoring system captures the thermal emissions during laser- powder interaction in the near-infrared region. The captured thermal emissions layer shows the areas with higher thermal emissions values, termed as ""hot-spot regions."" These hot spots regions are the highest potential areas of inducing defects in the final part. The same hypothesis is also confirmed by",The results of this study have been published in the journal Science.
83,"Mohr et al., where they showed the link between the porosity in the final part with the melt pool hot spot regions [34]. Therefore, in our study, we have termed layers with hotspots as ""Drift"" and the layers with no hot-spots as ""No-Drift."" However, it is essential to highlight that the hotspots are the most probable areas of causing a defect. Still, it cannot be guaranteed that there will be a defect at that location due to the complexity of the L-PBF process itself.","In our study, we have used the results of Mohr et al., where they showed the link between the porosity in the final part with the melt pool hot spot regions."
84,"5.4. Scale Variant of Anomalies in Pre and Post-Exposure cases The scale of the detection area dramatically influences the detection of any particular anomaly. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, if we take the scale of 20*20 px2 (Case 1- red box) for uneven powder spread, it may not be detectable similarly if we consider 150*150 px2 (Case 2 - green box) for Part-Hopping"" we may end up incorporating other anomalies such as Recoater-streaking: * Moreover, not all anomalies",In this paper we will look at the influence of the detection area on the detection of anomalies.

Therefore, it is of great importance to choose the correct spatial scale of the described anomalies such as ""Part-Hopping,"" - overheating, recoater-streaking, and uneven powder spread. Therefore, in our study, we have chosen three different scales for the above-described anomalies based on the trial-error method. Scale 1, i.e., 20* 20 px2 block, was set for ""Part-Hopping"" and overheating, as this anomaly should be captured with as small as possible scale.

It is also noted that all three scale blocks were extracted from the same center, and also the scale 1 blocks were non-overlapping, whereas the scale 2 and scale 3 are over overlapping blocks that stride with a step of the smallest block size.","In this paper, we present a three-scale model for the calculation of the coefficients of a CNN model, which was proposed to be used for the calculation of the coefficients of the coefficients"

The SVM classifiers predicted the two class labels, i.e., ""Drift"" and ""No-Drift,"" for each layer for the respective photodiode, as shown in Fig.14. (a,b). The layers numbered 2436, 2412, 2498, 2541, 2542, 2552, 2560, 2561, 2562, 2563, 2571, 2572, and 2573 were marked as drift layers for photodiode 2, whereas only two layers, i.e., 2541 and 2561, were marked as","In this study, 10 photodiode layers were trained to predict two class labels for each layer for the respective photodiode, as shown in Fig."

As presented in the previous section 2.3, the spectral detection range of both photodiodes is different. Therefore, it can be concluded that based on the type of material, one photodiode is more sensitive compared to another for specific materials, i.e., low and high melting materials. 180",The properties of two photodiodes are shown in Fig.

We have used the MPM viewer installed on the SLM 280HL system to verify the hotspots' presence in the predicted ""Drift"" layers. The screenshot of the MPM viewer for layer number 2561 (which was predicted ""Drift"" by both SVM classifiers also circled in red in Fig.14. (a,b)) is shown in Fig.15. It can be observed","In this paper, we have used two spatio-temporal Markov chain Monte Carlo (SVM) classifiers to predict ""Drift"" hotspots in printed circuit boards (PCBs"

These hotspots are the highest probable regions of producing defects in final parts. It is also noticeable that the hotspot regions in photodiode 1 (Fig.15. (a)) are not evident as like for photodiode 2 (Fig.15. (b)), which is because photodiode 2 spectral range is more sensitive to AISi7Mg0.6 (low melting material).",Fig.15 shows the thermal hotspots in photodiode 1 and photodiode 2.

These rectangular bars were printed for internal studies and are not included in this study. Therefore, it is vital to monitor each process step and establish a link between the different steps to improve the process's overall quality assurance.

189,"repeatability are a significant challenge due to uncertainties related to defects in the final parts. These defects can have a detrimental effect on the building part's performance, such as small porosities that can significantly degrade the final part's fatigue properties. The need for monitoring the process at each step is inevitable for building confidence about the final quality of the part. There are very few studies that have been focused on interlinking or monitoring the process at different steps.",This paper presents a study on the interlinking and monitoring of 3D printed building parts.
190,"Our study aims to monitor and post-process the in-situ data obtained at three different steps, i.e., Pre and Post-Exposure, and during exposure. Pre and Post-Exposure images capture critical information regarding the powder-bed spreading and printed layer quality. Therefore, both images were treated in an automated fashion using CNN models to detect the anomalies such as Part-Hopping/Part-Overheating: Recoater-Streaking: and ""Uneven Powder Spreading."" The scale variant of discussed anomalies is","In this paper, we present a novel method for monitoring the quality of printed circuit boards (PCBs) after powder-bed spreading."

Similarly, the Melt Pool Monitoring data were analyzed using the SVM classifier to classify the layers into ""Drift"" and ""No-Drift."" "" As the two photodiodes have different spatial detection limits, it was observed that photodiode 2 captures the drift occurring due to the presence of hotspots much efficiently than photodiode 1. A case study on ""Benchmark Part"" was done to check the proposed CNN model and SVM","In this paper, two photodiodes have been used to detect hotspots in a Melt Pool and to classify them into ""Drift"" and ""No-Drift."""

The full potential of the installed in-situ monitoring devices can only be realized by developing a closed- loop feedback control system by inter-linking the individual signals from each process step. It will help to improve the overall quality assurance oft the building part.,"In this paper, two case studies of in-situ monitoring of building part quality have been carried out."
