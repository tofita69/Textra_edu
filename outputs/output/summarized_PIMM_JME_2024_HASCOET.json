        "Bioprinting is a process that uses 3D printing techniques to combine cells, growth factors, and biomaterials to create biomedical components, often with the aim of imitating natural tissue characteristics. Typically, 3D bioprinting adopts a layer-by-layer method, using materials known as bio-inks to build structures resembling tissues. This study introduces an open-loop control system designed to improve the accuracy of extrusion-based bioprinting techniques, which is composed of a specific experimental setup and a series of algorithms and models.",
        "Firstly, a method employing Logistic Regression is used to select the tests that will serve to train and test the following model. Then, using a Machine Learning Algorithm, al model that allows the optimization of printing parameters and enables process control through an open-loop system was developed. Through rigorous experimentation and validation, it is shown that the model exhibits al high degree of accuracy in independent tests. Thus, the control system offers predictability and adaptability capabilities to ensure the consistent production",
        "of high-quality bioprinted structures. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of this machine learning model and the open-loop control system in achieving optimal bioprinting outcomes. 1. INTRODUCTION 3D Bioprinting, also known as Additive Biomanufacturing. is a process that involves positioning biomaterials and living cells layer by layer to create engineered tissues and organs",
        "in 3D, preserving cellular viability [1]. Bioinks, used in bioprinting, consist of natural or synthetic biomaterials mixed with living cells. They come in two main types: cell-based bioinks with live cells alone or hydrogel-based bioinks combined with cell-laden natural, synthetic, or decellularized tissue hydrogels. Coupled with post-processing to ensure the maturing of the living construct, the potential applications for bioprinting includes [2]: in vitro",

        "principles: extrusion-based bioprinting (EBB), droplet-based bioprinting (DBB), and light- based bioprinting (LBB) [3]: EBB employs a syringe-like extruder to deposit bioink as continuous filaments through a needle, accommodating a wide range of bioinks with high cell densities, suitable",
        "for complex tissues. DBB operates like inkjet printers, using bioink composed of living cells in a hydro- gel. It deposits tiny droplets using electrical, thermal, or acoustic energy, ideal for high-resolution printing and creating thin tissue layers and vascular networks. LBB uses laser power for precision through photopolymerization or bioink transfer,",
        "offering high cell viability and suitability for delicate structures. EBB is the most extended family of technologies [4] because of its simpler implementation and flexibility to work with various materials. Three main actuation systems are used: pneumatic, mechanical (screw-or plunge-driven), and solenoid-based systems. Among these, pneumatic actuation systems are the most widely spread, because of their",
        "simplicity and suitability for working in sterile conditions. Most commercial solutions for bioprinting use this technology. However, this approach poses a challenge to obtain geometrically accurate constructs: the complex relation between the input pressure and the output flow of material through the needle, which is dependent of the rheological properties of the material. On top of the material flowrate in the needle, the size and shape of the filament",
        "is also dependent on printing parameters as layer height, SO this relation is key to plan correctly the trajectories to bioprint a given construct. An imbalance between the expected size of the filament and the real one can lead to over-extrusion or under-extrusion. The error successively accumulates layer by layer, which leads to relatively important error in the final geometry.",
        "Usually, the method to attain a given filament size is through trial and error. All of the printing parameters fixed except for pressure, the latter is adjusted iteratively [5]. This leads to waste of bioink, very costly per unit volume. Imprecise measuring during the initial layer might lead to unsatisfactory results with an increasing number of layers, as the error is cumulative. This phenomenon is enhanced with increasing printing precision, i.e. with smaller",
        "layer height and needle diameter. On top of issues with the control of the geometry of the filament during the extrusion, the choice of materials and printing parameters is non-trivial, as optimizing final shape fidelity as well as cell survivability often leads to opposite requirements. Two of these dualities can be identified: (i) stiff hydrogels lead to more structural integrity VS. soft hydrogels lead to higher cell viability during the extrusion as well",
        "as more cell interaction after extrusion [6], (ii) smaller extrusion needle diameter leads to higher printing precision, but this also decreases cell viability as they suffer from more shear stress during printing. Rheological models have been tested to establish a relation between input pneumatic pressure and output material flowrate [7]. A rheological test is performed to characterize the bioink, using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). Results are then applied",
        "to a model, which predicts flowrate in function of input pressure. This method is incomplete as the relation between flowrate and filament size and shape is not straightforward given the layer height and printing speed. Furthermore, the manipulation of bioinks to perform J. Arduengo et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2024, Vol. 24, No. 1, 103-117 105",
        "the DMA test can be difficult and material consuming. This is depending on the equipment used, and the cost of the equipment can be very high. In recent years, machine learning (ML) models have gained the remarkable ability to discern intricate data interactions from experimental data, enabling them to extrapolate their findings to more complex scenarios and objects where traditional handcrafted rules may not apply (long). This transformation has",
        "triggered a change in thinking towards data-driven approaches in various engineering disciplines [8]. Establishing a correlation between process parameters and quality outcomes often necessitates the derivation of empirical models, which can be accomplished using conventional statistical tools or by embracing ML techniques [9]. Consequently, data-driven machine learning algorithms, equipped with robust predictive capabilities, offer distinct",
        "advantages when it comes to predicting behaviours and exploring novel models [10]. Recent studies have shown successful applications of machine learning techniques to enhance the 3D printing of biomaterials [11-15]. In these studies, ML has been employed for three main purposes: 1. Predicting and optimizing printing parameters [16], aiming to maximize the structural",
        "properties of the printed biomaterials, 2. Material printability optimization, i.e. studying suitable rheological properties which result in better printability [17] and 3. Quality assessment of prints, to identify defects or imperfections in the printed construct [18].",
        "In this paper, an open-loop control system using a ML model is proposed, consisting of an initial training phase, which uses a relatively low quantity of material (1 mL per 100 filaments approximately) and generates a precise model capable of predicting the output size and shape of the filament for a given material. It uses little supplementary material (two cameras) and can be applied to a large set of EBB techniques, including Micro-extrusion",
        "Bioprinting and FRESH [19]. A highly automatized protocol has been accomplished through the development of software communicating with all the instruments involved, which makes possible to attain a high cadence of data production (140 filaments created and analysed per hour). This allows the system to remain profitable in producing a high-quality ML model with little time investment. The model and is directly applicable after computing and can be",
        "extended afterwards to a wider range of printing parameters. Section 2 of this paper presents the state of the art in two fields: measuring techniques in the scope of bioprinting and Machine Learning models. Section 3 presents materials, methods, and approaches that the authors used to collect data and train the model, showing an implementation of this open-loop control system, as well as results following the application of each method. Finally, Section 4",
        "discusses conclusions and perspectives. 2. STATE OF THE ART 2.1. GEOMETRY MEASUREMENT Geometry measurement in bioprinting has its own challenges given the specific constraints of the domain: (i) soft and thermally sensitive materials and (ii) sterility needs to",
        "106 J. Arduengo et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2024, Vol. 24, No. 1, 103-117 be preserved to ensure the correct development of living cells. Thus, non-invasive measuring methods need to be implemented. Many techniques have been used to achieve this, which go from 2D imagery, which allows to measure geometry from a 2D perspective, to scanning,",
        "which allows the direct reconstruction of 3D shapes. Some of these techniques are listed below: Common optical sensors include high-speed cameras, pyrometers, in-line cameras, and in-line photodetectors [20]. These optical sensors can provide great insight into each layer, but are limited to observing only the surfaces.",
        "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique that uses low- coherence light to capture micrometer-resolution, 2D- and 3D-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). OCThas recently been proposed to provide sub-surface information regarding the printed part [21, 22]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a 3D imaging technique that offer a high",
        "measurement depth for monitoring and characterizing heterogeneous soft (hydrated) materials at ambient conditions [23]. Ultrasonic sensors have been used to detect subsurface defects by sending ultrasonic waves [24, 25]. For the purpose of the system to be implemented in this paper, common optical sensors",
        "and more precisely cameras are an optimal choice, because of their ease of integration and capacity to detect edges on any kind of material (provided an adequate background). To overcome the limitation of recovering only 2D geometry, multiple views can be used to measure different dimensions, although full 3D surface reconstruction remains out of scope. 2.2. PHYSICAL MODELS",
        "Many physical models based on the rheology of the bioinks have been developed. Bioinks are usually modelled as shear-thinning fluids, which enables to deduce the equation of the flow through the extrusion needle and thus estimate the size of the printed filament, as for example, in the Ostwald-de Waele model [7]. These models have been proven precise within bounded operating limits but may struggle to properly predict results in atypical",
        "operating conditions (for instance, with high pressures) [26]. In addition, as these models only predict flow through the extrusion needle, they do not provide information about the shape of the filament once extruded as it is affected by gravity. This information is key as EBB techniques build layer by layer, SO it is the precise knowledge of final filament shape that allows for overall high printing precision.",
        "2.3. MACHINE LEARNING METHODS Numerical models can be an alternative to guide the experimentations and drastically reduce the numbers of trials for optimizing the parameters. Yet, such numerical models do not exist. Hence, a methodology is proposed to build a numerical direct model predicting the shape and size of a filament for a given set of parameters. This model is data-driven, based",

This way, once calibrated, no more experiments would be required to investigate the best sets of parameters for a desired filament result. For data-driven modelling, Artificial Intelligence, and especially",
        "Machine Learning in this context, is the numerical tool to be used. Indeed, a non-linear multi- parametric model can be performed, relating inputs and outputs. Once the relations found based on data points, the model can be queried for a new set of parameters to be tested and answers in real-time. The studied data points used for training the model are in this case the experiments parameters and a photo of the result filament.",
        "Once this direct model validated, an inverse model can be built for the final objective. Indeed, in use the numerical model must advise the experiment with optimal process parame- ters based on a target geometry. 3. MATERIALS, METHODS, AND RESULTS 3.1.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND MATERIALS",
        "The experimental setup consists of the following elements (cf. Fig. 1): Bioprinter: This is a self-developed prototype in the lab. It is a Cartesian machine with three axes. A linear motor (Parker, MX80LS) drives each axis (with approximately a 140 mm travel and a precision of 0.1 um). The Z-axis moves the syringe holder vertically, while the X and y-axes move the platform. An MC405",
        "motion controller (Trio Motion Technology) controls the axes. It uses an ARM11 processor.

        "Sequential filament printing: For each line, the machine approaches the starting position. Horizontal displacement begins simultaneously with the activation of pressure, which is deactivated upon reaching the end of the trajectory of a total length of 20 mm. The velocity profile is trapezoidal, meaning there is constant acceleration and deceleration until the desired velocity is achieved. Subsequently, the needle is",

Finally, the plate is moved to a position where the current glass slide can be easily removed. The operator can then 110 J.

Ending: once all the filaments have been printed, the program stops and automatically outputs a data file relating each photograph with its corresponding set",
        "of parameters. 3.3. TEST SELECTION It is possible that for a given set of printing parameters, the flowrate is not sufficient (known as under-extrusion) and thus a non-continuous filament is obtained. This situation is to be avoided as the model is intended to predict the width and height of a continuous filament.",
        "In order to optimize the number of tests that are useful as input data, a prior test selection with a high probability of being continuous is carried out. For this purpose, an initial set of tests has been run in a very wide range of parameters, which will surely have a considerable number of non-continuous filaments. The classification of each filament as continuous or disconti- nuous is associated with the values of the process parameters, which allows the construction",
        "of a Logistic Regression Model (LRM): f(z) = 1 with Z = A + Bp + Cu + Dh, p 1+e being the pressure expressed in bars, 1 the speed expressed in mm/s and h the needle height with respect to the printing surface expressed in mm, and A, B,C and D the parameters of the model. The resulting LMR predicts the probability (from 0 to 1) of a filament being",
        "continuous given a set of input parameters. This model is applicable, therefore, for making informed decisions about configuring parameters in filament printing experiments. A series of prior longitudinal filament printing tests (154 in total) have been conducted, involving the wide-ranging variation of different process parameters and variables, and observing the production of continuous or discontinuous filaments. The resulting LRM is the",
        "following: f(z) 1 with Z = 4.3 + 2p = 0.1v = 0.3h. The confusion matrix for the set 1+e of tests carried out with a probability threshold of 0.8, which reasonably ensures that the specific combination of parameters allows for the printing of continuous filaments, is the",

Fig. 3) shows the line which represents the LRM model isoquant at the chosen threshold (f(z) = 0.8) VS the data points used to compute the model. Any filament whose parameters fall under the line is given a probability higher than 0.8 to be continuous. It is possible to conclude that the layer height has a low effect on continuity and",
        "that probability of continuity increases with pressure and decreases with velocity. To produce a working model for the open-loop system exposed in this article, the geometry of each filament needs to be retrieved.

Specifically, a small quantity of bioink (under 5 ml) has been used to print a series of 420 filaments in a semi-automatic setup. This data has been used to automatically compute a high accuracy Machine-Leaming model (R3> 0.91) covering three",
        "key printing parameters in a wide range. This enables to advice printing parameters that produce a filament of specific size with a mean squared error of 5.0 um for the width and 3.1 m for the height of the filaments. In conclusion, the following step would be to take advantage of this real-time approach to compute optimal parameters during the bioprinting [32] with a closed-loop control [33].",
        "Indeed, a deviation can be automatically detected between the printed bead and the target geometry with the steps (i) automatic captures and (ii) image processing. From this deviation, an optimal set of parameters can be advised to correct the continuation of the printing. This will be validated in a closed-loop perspective with experimental data with objective of real-time in-process correction.",
