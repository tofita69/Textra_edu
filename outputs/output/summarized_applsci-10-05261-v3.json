Introduction Injuries are commonplace in professional soccer. According to a recent study [1), the overall incidence of injuries in elite male soccer players ranges from 2.5 to 9.4 injuries per 1000 h of exposure.",
        "These authors also showed that the risk of injury is higher during matches than training sessions. One of the last epidemiological studies highlighting the increase of injuries over the past 16 years, has emphasized that muscle incidents were the main cause [2]. Injuries being ubiquitous in this type of complex sport [3] there are several risk factors such as the number of played matches, the accumulation of fatigue induced by the workload during and following training sessions, etc.",
        "Within this context, non-contact injuries are often regarded as preventable and linked to internal and external risk factors related to workload [4). It is therefore essential to quantify properly, over time, the training and competitive match workloads for any injury prediction approach in soccer. In addition, the total training load tends to increase along with the annual performance objectives. Therefore, monitoring the internal load experienced by thej player as the combination of the",
        "physiological (heart rate measurements [5]) and psychological (perception questionnaires [6]) stresses and the external load (i.e., the mechanical work completed by the player) during both training and Appl.

        "2of 20 competition is of fundamental importance to allow the individualization of training activities [7] as well as the identification of potential injury risk at the individual player level. Many studies have already examined soccer activity. Randers et al. [8] indicated that analytical tools such as video and wearable technology like Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and inertial",
        "sensors can provide accurate mechanical data about players activities both during training and in competition. Several important performance-related features have been highlighted, such as distances travelled at different speeds, accelerations, decelerations and maximum speed [9]. For instance, the average distance travelled in matches by elite soccer players is of 9 to 12 km [9,10]. Sprinting in particular is often considered as a major component of performance, but ultimately it only represents",
        "10% of the total distance covered during matches [11]. These various metrics among others (e.g., acceleration and deceleration ranges, changes of direction) are regularly used to quantify external load. Both high and low external loads lead to injury risk, with suggestions that there may be an optimum load threshold for individuals [12]. Besides objective physical tests, it is also possible to use subjective measures to predict injury risk. The session Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) has been",
        "used for injury risk estimation [13-15). Indeed, recent research in elite soccer recording contact and non-contact injuries has identified a link between internal workload (using session RPE) and injury incidence [16] while no relationship between internal load and non-contact injuries was observed in other studies [14]. The large amount of features recorded from the assessment of external load (GPS and inertial",
        "sensors) and internal load (associated with subjective well-being questionnaires and RPE) can be used together in order to better capture the relationship between both internal and external loads [17] and predict in turn players injury. However, the more massive collected data, the more complex their managing. It is now acknowledged that machine learning methods applied to sport can provide accurate diagnostic and decision tools for training management and injury risk assessment but are not",

One of the first investigations that tried to predict non-contact: injuries in team-sports using machine-learning methods was conducted by Rossi et al. [19]. Starting from the observation thati injury risk assessment by applying the so-called açute:chronic workload ratio (e.g., used in Raya-Gonzaled et al. [14]) led to inaccurate and poor prediction abilities, Rossi et al. [19] proposed a multi-dimensional approach to injury prediction",
        "in professional soccer based on external load data collected through GPS measurements. For that purpose, they trained decision trees that predict whether or not a player is likely to get injured in the next match or training session. Such non-linear models applied only to external training load showed better performance: metrics than traditional statistical methods for predicting injury risk [19]. However these performances are far from being optimal for the prediction of injuries, i.e., 50% of",
        "precision and 80% of recall. Altogether, it appears that, to our knowledge, the scientific literature remains very scarce on the problem of injury prediction in elite soccer from internal and external loads together in a multi-dimensional non-linear machine learning based model. Therefore, given the amount of data collected in modern elite soccer regarding both external and internal loads, it's nowadays relevant to apply machine-learning methods to a pre-established set of",

We put forward the main hypothesis that using such type machine-learning methods would be able to inform us with good prediction performance. about injury risks over two. horizons (one week and one month) by considering the combined evolution of both internal and external training loads.

Discussion In view of the overall results of this study, some notable facts should be noted. First, for 1-week injury prediction, questionnaire (internal load features) data are more accurate than GPS (external load",
        "features) ones, which even tend to deteriorate: injury prediction when included in the learning data. For 1-month injury prediction, the classifiers learnt from GPS or questionnaire data show roughly the same performance levels, the best one being usually reached when combining GPS and questionnaire data. In terms of interpretation, decision trees graphs and features importance weights computation have highlighted a specific player profile at high injury risk and some specific features involved in",
        "precision and recall optimisation. To the best of our knowledge, the work of Rossi et al. [19] is the single that used a non-linear classifier, decision tree, in a multi-dimensional context to predict injuries in elite soccer. Thus, we decided to focus part of our discussion to this study. For comparison, the decision trees used in the study by Rossi et al. [19] detected about 80% of the injuries in the sample analyzed with an accuracy",
        "of approximately 50% (with external load features). As a result, the algorithm used in our machine learning approach would be able to classify more accurately the so-called at-risk players regarding the past occurrence of injuries and thus be able to continue to perform without being disturbed by \"false alarms\". The accuracy of this tree, particularly at 1 week, which differs from Rossi et al. [19], is made possible by linking GPS data and subjective questionnaires throughout the classifiers, which justifies",
        "the contribution of this work to the current literature linking data science and sport science [17,19,36]. In the present study, we showed that subjective variables have a very high predictive/explanatory potential (compared to objective variables) but they are more expensive, i.e., having all players completing questionnaires before and after training can be complicated given their tight schedules and their willingness. Nevertheless, professional teams that can not outfit players with GPS sensors for",
        "practical or economic reasons should consider use questionnaires in order to detect players at high injury risk [37,38]. Another point that validates the choice of tree-based classifiers is that those models naturally provide feature importance weights that can help coaches to monitor some specific indicators and be used as useful decision support tools for training optimization. It should be noted that in this case,",
        "subjective questionnaires are very valuable especially for short-term prediction even when they are completed by only some players at some training sessions. Except for 1-week injury risk precision, ensemble models seem preferable compared to single trees even if they do not provide single tree graphs. In addition, the interest of this study lies in the coupling of the machine learning methods and the variations of the training load (internal and external). It can be noticed that even when both types",
        "of features (GPS and questionnaires) are used as inputs, the most important and sensitive features are almost always associated with subjective variables. It can therefore be hypothesized that with these data and this sample in this particular situation, internal load would be a determining factor in the prediction of injury. In other words, it would be essential for each coach to pay particular attention to the athletes' feelings before and after training sessions in order to prevent injuries from occurring.",
        "To conclude, the fact that questionnaires features can replace GPS ones and even increase predictive performance by doing sO suggests that a part of the information related to external load is included in the internal load's one. While an individual may perform the same external load, their ability to respond to this output (internal load) may differ [17,39]. Utilizing both measures provides a comprehensive view on whether an individual is in a state of \"readiness\" and able to",
        "tolerate high loads, or in a state \"fatigue\" and potentially at risk of injury or decreased performance. Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 5261 15 of 20 Internal load being reflected by the external load provides additional information of the players that the external load could not take into consideration. In our study, we highlighted that several subjective",
        "questionnaires reflect likely different aspects of the training load related to the stress that thej players may support. For instance, monitoring pre-training perceived fatigue, mood, pain, shape and sleep for each player may offer an indication on the quality of the external output that might be produced prior to a session and provides coaches with the ability to make adjustments if warranted. Monitoring is not limited to either subjective or objective measures, instead they can be used to complement each other.",
        "This is consistent with recommendations [38]. To sump up, the potential efficacy of subjective measures for soccer player monitoring has been established, however optimal implementation practices are yet to be determined. Limitation and Future Directions However, in a study with preliminary data, some limitations exist, but are: in fact potential sources",
        "of improvement. As a result, a larger sample size, extending to several teams with different training strategies over multiple seasons, would allow more general conclusions to be drawn about injury prediction. In addition, the GPS data and questionnaires collection and imputations methods can also be improved. With regard to the completed questionnaires, the influence of greater diligence in the use of these questionnaires by players would be fundamental to observe. As for GPS data, they are",
        "present in an average form compared to their initial acquisition frequency of 10 Hz. In the race for performance, it would be interesting to observe the consequences of using all the raw values acquired at this frequency. Also, due to the differences between players, individualization could be considered in regards to the variables relating to external load (data extracted from GPS), by computing speed and acceleration thresholds specific to each player beyond which injuries is likely to occur. By doing",
        "sO, the predictive potential of GPS variables could be greatly increased, and could have an influence on the training strategies implemented by coaches. Since not-injured players are: much easier to find in datasets and injury is not a controllable factor, data augmentation could be used in order to simulate more injury examples from the real ones. Those artificial examples would probably improve the predictive performances of classifiers.",
        "5. Conclusions The objective of this study was to address the issue of using various machine learning methods for injury prediction from the athlete' 's internal and external loads conjointly. The results of this study show that depending on the complexity of the predictive model, the different predictive metrics values for injury prediction are close to 100%, especially with a 1-month time horizon. In addition,",
        "it appears that the subjective variables (i.e., internal load) of the pre-session questionnaire (such as sleep quality, fatigue, shape, mood) as well as post-session questionnaire (satisfaction and pleasure) and RPE are found to be determining factors in the occurrence of injuries. Overall, our findings provide further justification for the implementation of a team-wide monitoring strategy of internal load in elite soccer players.",
        "Finally, although the preliminary results of this paper appear encouraging and relevant, future research with a larger sample size by involving several teams from the same championship can provide sufficient data to move from specific conclusions to general ones about machine learning methods.
