In addition,",The aim of this study was to address the issue of using various machine learning methods for injury prediction from the athlete's internal and external loads conjointly,summarized_applsci-10-05261-v3.csv
154,"it appears that the subjective variables (i.e., internal load) of the pre-session questionnaire (such as sleep quality, fatigue, shape, mood) as well as post-session questionnaire (satisfaction and pleasure) and RPE are found to be determining factors in the occurrence of injuries. Overall, our findings provide further justification for the implementation of a team-wide monitoring strategy of internal load in elite soccer players.",The effects of a team-wide monitoring strategy of internal load in elite soccer players on the occurrence of injuries have been investigated in a cross-country,summarized_applsci-10-05261-v3.csv

Preferential segregation of Cr and Mo occurs at the interdendritic regions in any as-built 316L microstructure. These segregations affect the solubility limit between oxides and the matrix, and hence their stability [5). In addition, the equilibrium stability of oxides highly depends on the Si content [2): depending of the Si content the",The stability of Cr and Mo in 316L is well known.,summarized_gaudez_2023additive-manufacturing.csv

Finally, if recrystallization occurs during the thermal treatments, then it would affect the evolution of MnSiO3 precipitates [5). Due to the metastable nature of any additively manufactured microstructure, evolution towards more stable phases is then expected during annealing of 316L. Assuming the transformation occurs from MnSiO3 to SiO2, a lower mole fraction of precipitates for a fixed alloy oxygen content is then expected due to the","The microstructure of 316L, a martensitic chromium-nickel alloy, could be modelled using a number of methods.",summarized_gaudez_2023additive-manufacturing.csv

Conversely, precipitation of CrMn204 (4/7 at% 0) would result in a higher mole fraction of precipitates for a fixed alloy oxygen content. However, these differences between the oxygen content of precipitates are small and they cannot explain the observed decrease in f and dissolution of precipitates. In addition, the molar volumes of the oxide precipitates considered are similar and do not result in a strong change in f.

This phenomenon has been observed in stainless steels annealed at high temperatures with the evaporation of Mn, Cr, Si, and O elements [35-37] accompanied with the reduction of oxides [36,37). Evaporation is a time and temperature dependent mechanism; longer is the treatment or higher is the temperature or both, higher is the amount of released elements [34.

To assess this mechanism, finite difference simulations were performed to track chemical species evo- lution across the micropillar under vacuum.

However, standard ANNs perform poorly for strain increments smaller and larger than the ones at which it was trained (As = 1 X 103, cf. Table 2). And in these cases, 24","In this paper, we show how standard ANNs can be used to train experimental systems.",summarized_Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks for constitutive modeling.csv

Moreover, the quantities of primary interest, such as the stress, the internal state variable, and the energy are in extremely good agreement with the reference model. The same stands also for the dissipation rate. We notice, once more, that its values are always positive, even when","In this paper, we show that a new class of artificial neural networks (ANNs), called TANNS, can be used to predict",summarized_Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks for constitutive modeling.csv

TANNS successfully still predict the response in this limiting case, while ANNs do not. Indeed, the training data were generated guaranteeing an accuracy of the order of 10-6 in terms of strains and such small strain increments are at the margin of the computing precision.","In this paper we present a novel model for predicting the response of a strain to a given chemical reaction, called TANNS.",summarized_Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks for constitutive modeling.csv
