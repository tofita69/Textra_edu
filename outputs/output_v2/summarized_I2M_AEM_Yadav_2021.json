        "Quality assurance of the final build part in L-PBF is greatly influenced by the various process steps such as Powder handling, Powder bed spreading, and Laser-material interaction. Each process step is interlinked",
        "to each other and can affect the overall behavior of the succeeding steps. Therefore, it is vital to monitor each step individually, post-process, and establish a link among the data to develop an approach to quantify the defects via inline monitoring. This study focuses on using pre-and post-exposure powder bed",
        "image data and in-situ melt pool monitoring data to monitor the build's overall quality. Two Convolutional Neural Networks have been trained to treat the pre and post-exposure images with a trained accuracy of 93.16 % and 96.20 %, respectively. The supervised machine-learning algorithm called \"Support Vector",
        "Machine\" is used to classify and post-process the photodiodes data obtained from the melt pool monitoring. A case study on \"Benchmark Part\" is presented to check the proposed algorithms' overall working and detect abnormalities at three different process steps (Pre and Post-Exposure, Melt Pool",

Keywords: Machine Learning, Laser powder bed fusion, Quality assurance, Melt pool monitoring, Defect detection 1. Introduction",
        "Recently, Additive manufacturing (AM) has observed tremendous growth in various industries such as aerospace, biomedical, automotive, energy, and tooling due to its capability to manufacture complex parts with ease. According to Wohler's report of 2019, the metal additive manufacturing industry has",
        "shown record growth with an increase of 41.9 % [1). The reported growth indicates that the AM industry has significant potential in patient-specific medical implants, lightweight components for the aerospace and automotive sector, which eventually reduced fuel consumption. However, the process repeatability",
        "and reliability remain a significant concern in AM [2]. Therefore, the need for implementing in-situ or real- time monitoring sensors is inevitable. Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) also, commonly known as selective laser melting (SLM) or direct laser",
        "melt sintering (DMLS), is one of the many additive manufacturing techniques. L-PBF uses the metal powder material deposited in a layer by layer fashion to create a 3-Dimensional (3-D) model from a digital computer-aided design (CAD) design. After each powder recoating layer, the laser fuses the metal powder",
        "material selectively fort that specific layer; afterward, the next new layer of powder is uniformly distributed by the recoater. The process repeats until the whole 3D model is manufactured. The total manufacturing time can vary from hours to days, based on the part's geometrical features. Despite tremendous",
        "technological advancements in developing the latest commercial L-PBF systems, the process reliability and repeatability still need to materialize. Thus, the L-PBF process has many input parameters that can significantly influence the part's overall quality [3-5]. For instance, Van Elsen has listed at least 50",
        "parameters that can affect the final part quality [6]. The expensive and time-consuming non-destructive techniques (NDT) such as computer tomography (CT) is used to check the overall part health and quantify the defects [6]. Therefore, to improve the comprehensive quality assurance and monitor the process in",
        "real-time, active research is directed on using in-situ sensors based on real-time monitoring, data analytics, and process control. The overall thrust has been developing the models with hardware and data analytics techniques to isolate the type, location, and severity of the defects in real-time [7). The final aim",
        "can be achieved by developing a closed feedback control loop to mitigate these defects inline. In the literature, different means of measurement, such as infrared thermography, pyrometry, optical spectroscopy, ultrasonic sensors, etc., are reported to monitor the L-PBF process [8]. Considering the",
        "subject's vast scope, we focus mainly on reviewing the recent development in fault detection in the L-PBF process using machine learning based on sensors' responses. A large scale of data being generated with an increase in the number of sensors used to monitor the",
        "process. An extensive set of data also poses a significant challenge related to storage and post-processing. Machine learning (ML) is an alternative way to cope with the challenges mentioned above. Furthermore, ML can post-process the data in real-time. Many powerful and sophisticated ML models have been",
        "developed with advanced hardware in the last decade, capable of identifying complex non-linear relationships from massive data [9-12]. Ideally, ML approaches can be divided into three subgroups: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Supervised ML requires a labeled dataset to",
        "train the specific model. In other words, each training datapoint has a label, e.g., \"good\" and \"bad,\" and users must know the ground truth of the training dataset before learning. In many applications such as",
        "AM, sometimes, it is a very costly and laborious task to understand the data points' labels. Whereas in the unsupervised ML approach, there is no prior requirement of the labels for the training dataset. The",
        "algorithm tries to find a pattern based on some relationships among the dataset. As the name suggests, the semi-supervised learning approach uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches at the same time. In other words, it requires both labeled and unlabeled datasets. This approach can be",
        "helpful where obtaining the ground truth dataset is a very challenging task [13-16]. Abdelrahman et al. proposed in-situ flaw detection using a layerwise optical imaging system that captures the powder bed's images before and post-printing in the L-PBF process. The images were captured in",
        "different lighting conditions to enhance the chances of flaw detection. The proposed approach showed a sensitivity of 91.5 % and specificity of 84 % [17). Scime and Beuth used a visible range optical camera to",
        "capture the powder bed images, which were then used to detect powder bed flaws such as \"Part- Hopping, part failure, streaking, super-elevation, .etc by using computer vision and machine learning approaches. In their earlier work, they have proposed a machine learning algorithm called \"bag of words\"",
        "to classify the flaws mentioned above with an accuracy ranging from 65% to 99 % [18]. Their recent work has proposed a multi-scale Convolutional neural network (CNN) based using a transfer learning approach, which showed an accuracy of 72.7 % [19]. Okaro et al. developed a semi-supervised model using",
        "photodiode data to classify the finished parts based on their mechanical properties. The reported model showed an accuracy of 77 % [20]. Gobert et al. proposed a supervised ML approached based on the layerwise in-situ images captured using a digital single-lens reflex camera. The proposed supervised ML",
        "approach was able to predict cracking, porosity, lack of fusion defects with a reported accuracy of 85 %. The anticipated MLI results were matched with the CT scans results as well [21]. Ye et al. and Schevchik et",
        "al. used an acoustic signals-Dased ML model for defect detection. The proposed model showed an accuracy of 70 % on raw data and 93 % for the Fourier transformed processed data [22, 23]. Khanzadeh et al. compared different supervised ML approaches for the melt pool monitoring images. The k-nearest",
        "neighbor algorithm showed the best results with an accuracy of 98 % to label melt pool signatures as regular melt pools or pores [24]. Yuan et al. developed a CNN model to monitor the single deposited",
        "tracks' quality using co-axial high-speed video camera data. The training dataset was prelabeled using the offline characterization techniques such as macroscopic analysis of the deposited tracks, which was further used to predict the deposited consistency using a trained CNN model [25]. Imani et al. fabricated",
        "cylindrical samples with varying power, scanning speed, and hatch distance to induce varied samples' varied porosity. The obtained samples were quantified for the distribution of the porosity using computer tomography. In parallel, the parts' in-situ images were analyzed using the spectral graph approach, and",
        "extracted features were further used as input for machine learning algorithms [26]. Recently, Williams et al. developed a deep learning (DL) model called densely connected convolutional block architecture for multi-modal image regression (DCB-MIR) to detect defects such as porosity and geometric deviations in",
        "titanium and Inconel parts. They have used the optical image derived from the acoustic velocity maps as the proposed model's input data. Williams et al. proposed a cosine similarity ranging from 25 % to 60 %",
        "between optical signature and optical micrographs derived from DCB-MIR [27). Clijsters et al. proposed a novel data analytics method to check the quality ofthe parts in the L-PBF process. The melt pool signatures were captured with a combination of near-infrared range CMOS camera and photodiode. Later, a mapping",
        "algorithm was modeled to capture the phenomenon's like overheating, detection ofthe pore in 2-D space, and 3-D space based on the data from both sensors [28]. Recently, Chen et al. studied the effect of recoating orientation, hatching pattern, height, and width on the roughness of the thin-wall structures by",
        "using a model based on the computer tomography images and CAD design of the part [29]. Machine learning techniques have recently gained much attention from many AM field researchers due to their easy applicability and versatile nature to solve the problems related to post-processing of the in-",
        "situ data in the AM process. The use of machine learning approaches in L-PBF processes is summarized in [8]. Before proceeding further, it shall be essential to discuss the challenges associated with the machine learning approaches in the AM process, especially with L-PBF, which are as follows: 1.",
        "The artificial neural networks (ANN) predominately works on a large set of the labeled training dataset, which is a very challenging and laborious task in the L-PBF process. It is very challenging to quantify and detect defects in the captured in-situ data and often requires expensive and time-consuming",
        "techniques such as computer tomography for quantification of the defects. Therefore, the inherent challenge to the L-PBF process is that the ML approaches developed tend to be a part, material, or geometry specific. 2. Secondly, the multi-scale nature of the L-PBF process defects is another major challenge. The",
        "defects, such as internal porosity, can be < 100 um, whereas the geometric distortion can be > 1mm. Therefore, it not feasible to use one type of sensor to detect all types of defects. With an increasing number of sensors, there is multiplication in data generation, eventually increasing post-processing complexity.",
        "3. Thirdly, the defects are also linked with the different steps in the process itself. Therefore, it is vital to monitor the process at all possible levels such as powder health, powder spread quality, post-",
        "exposure quality, monitoring while printing, final part health, etc. All steps are interlinked with each other. Therefore, overall monitoring will improve the quality assurance and reliability of the process. This study focuses on using a combination of ML and DL algorithms to monitor the L-PBF process at three",
        "different stages, i.e., Pre-Exposure step, Post-Exposure Step, and Exposure (Fig. 1). We have used two separate CNN models for treating the Pre and Post-Exposure images captured using Layer Control System (LCS) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to post-process the photodiodes data obtained from",
        "Melt Pool Monitoring. We present a case study on \"Benchmark Part\" to check the robustness of the proposed algorithms. This study serves as the initial step to discuss the possibilities of interlinking the different monitoring steps via post-processing ofthe data and improving the confidence interval regarding",
        "the product health. The working principle of CNN Models and SVM classifier can be found in supporting material.

        "exposure images) and SVM classifier (For melt pool monitoring), a balanced dataset comprising an equal number of each label is necessary. An artificial drift is introduced in the samples to obtain the balanced ground-truth dataset of each label. Therefore, the unique geometrical specimens were printed, as shown",
        "in Fig. 2. The process parameters tabulated in Table 2 were varied to obtain varied volumetric energy density in the range of 40-73 J/mm3 for each shown geometry. The decision to vary the process",

        "2. Uneven Powder Spread: The \"Un-even Powder Spread\" indicates the areas where the lack of uniformity in powder spread is observed. Such anomaly can be caused due to recoater silicon lip failure, lack of powder, and part failure.",
        "3. Part Overheating: The \"Part-Overheating\" is the area of the part which is distorted due to poor heat conductivity. The poor heat flow phenomenon is linked to the lack of proper support structures beneath the part [33). This anomaly is considered only for the post-exposure images.",
        "4. Part Hopping: The area of the part which is above the powder spread and not fully covered by the powder spread is termed \"Powder Hopping. \" This anomaly is considered only for the pre- exposure images. In the context of this study, the part hopping serves as cross-validation criteria",
        "for the anomaly part-overheating\" in the post-exposure images. 5. Recoater Streaking: Recoater streaking is the horizontal lines observed in the powder bed images due to distortion of the soft silicon lip of the recoater. Recoater streaking is detected in post pre and post-exposure images. 3.2. Terminology related to MPM data",
        "1. Hotspot: The layer's area is termed as \"Hotspot,\" which has higher thermal counts than the rest of the layer. These hotspots are the most probable areas of causing drift in the final part. The",
        "same hypothesis is also confirmed by Mohr et al. where they showed the link between the porosity in the final part with the melt pool hot spot regions [34] 2. Drift Layer: The layers which comprise the hotspots mentioned above are termed as \"Drift Layer.\"",
        "Identifying hotspots and labeling the layers as \"Drift Layer\" was done manually suing MPM viewer provided by SLM Solutions. 3. No-Drift Layer: The absence of the hotspots in the respective layers are defined as \"No-Drift Layer.\" 4. Image Preprocessing",
        "The captured raw images (1500*1460 px?) possess difficulties such as in-homogeneity in light intensity. Therefore, they cannot be used directly for CNN operations. As the camera and environment conditions remain unchanged for all the captured images, the same homogeneity correction factor can be used for",
        "all images. For light intensity homogenization, we have used the in-built functions of MATLAB called 'imcomplement, and 'imreducehaze\" [35-37]. For our studies, we have used the maximum haze value of 1, which removes the maximum haze from the image. Firstly, the captured raw image was converted",
        "to a grayscale image to reduce the operation's complexity and our CNN model's requirement. The grayscale image was then complemented, which means it inverts the pixel values. In other words, the black is converted into white and vice-versa. Then the 'imreducehaze\" function was used on the complemented image (Equation 1):",

        "J(x) = (I(x) = A)/(max (T(x),T(0) + A) (2) The dehazing function involves steps as follows: 1. Firstly, the atmospheric light (L(x)) is estimated using a dark channel. 2. Secondly, the transmission map (T(x)) is estimated. 3. Refinement of the estimated transmission map (T(x)). 4. Restoration of the image.",
        "5. Lastly, perform contrast enhancement on the restored image. Fig. 4 shows an example of a raw image and image after preprocessing operation. It can be observed that even after the preprocessing operation, the light intensity is not entirely homogenized at the edges.",
        "Therefore, we do not take into consideration the edges for CNN operation and start the algorithm only for an area of 1000*1000 px? as marked in the red rectangle box. The dimensions oft the region ofi interest",
        "are selected intuitively; most of the time, parts are built at the build plate's center. Intentionally, cropping of the image is avoided to minimize the border effect and prevent operation padding, significantly",
        "affecting border patches results. If we consider the borders, it will not be possible to select the blocks with the same center as the sizes vary enormously. Secondly, the light intensity at the borders may also affect the accuracy of the overall model. Area considered for CNN operation (a) (b)",

Melt Pool Monitoring Anomalies",
        "As explained in section 2.3, the melt pool monitoring system captures the thermal emissions during laser- powder interaction in the near-infrared region. The captured thermal emissions layer shows the areas with higher thermal emissions values, termed as \"hot-spot regions.\" These hot spots regions are the",
        "highest potential areas of inducing defects in the final part. The same hypothesis is also confirmed by Mohr et al., where they showed the link between the porosity in the final part with the melt pool hot spot",
        "regions [34]. Therefore, in our study, we have termed layers with hotspots as \"Drift\" and the layers with no hot-spots as \"No-Drift.\" However, it is essential to highlight that the hotspots are the most probable",

        "The scale of the detection area dramatically influences the detection of any particular anomaly. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, if we take the scale of 20*20 px2 (Case 1- red box) for uneven powder spread,",
        "it may not be detectable similarly if we consider 150*150 px2 (Case 2 - green box) for Part-Hopping\" we may end up incorporating other anomalies such as Recoater-streaking: * Moreover, not all anomalies have the same spatial detection scale. Therefore, it is of great importance to choose the correct spatial",
        "scale of the described anomalies such as \"Part-Hopping,\" - overheating, recoater-streaking, and uneven powder spread. Therefore, in our study, we have chosen three different scales for the above-described anomalies based on the trial-error method. Scale 1, i.e., 20* 20 px2 block, was set for \"Part-Hopping\" and",
        "overheating, as this anomaly should be captured with as small as possible scale. The 20* 20 px2 scale is a good compromise between the computational time and the proposed CNN model's accuracy. Scale 2, i.e.,",
        "75*75 px?, was chosen for Recoater-Streaking: \" whereas scale 3, i.e., 150*150 px?, was set for uneven powder spread. It is also noted that all three scale blocks were extracted from the same center, and also",
        "the scale 1 blocks were non-overlapping, whereas the scale 2 and scale 3 are over overlapping blocks that stride with a step of the smallest block size. Case 1 Case 2 - D",
        "Fig. 7. An example of scale variance of different types of anomalies is shown. Red box represents the scale 1 of size 20*20 px2 whereas the scale 3 represented by green box which has size of 150*150 px?. 6. Training and Testing of Models 6.1. Training CNN models",
        "The CNN training aims to find the optimal kernels for the given case. In our CNN model, we have used the standard loss function for regression predictions and cross-entropy loss, which is shown as H(p,q) =",
        "- Lx q(x) logp(x) where p(x) is the classification function from softmax operation corresponding to the input image used for classification operation whereas q(x) is the ground-truth label of that image. The minimization of loss function during training is the optimal criterion for the selection of optimal kernels.",
        "During training, kernel weights are recursively updated by using the training images. The prediction error gradient decides the updating of the weights for each layer backpropagated for that layer. It shows the direction of weight adjustment, which allows a steep decrease in prediction error. For our CNN model, we",
        "have utilized the sgdm optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10-3 for regression, batch size of 20, and max training epoch number of 100. L2 regularization is applied to all the weights for suppressing over-",
        "fitting. The regularization coefficient is set as 10-3. For both CNN models, i.e., CNN 1 and CNN 2, the best- fit settings are the same, which showed the highest training accuracy for both pre and post-exposure",
        "images. The reported training accuracy of CNN 1 and the CNN 2 models is 93.16 % and 96.20 % for pre and post-exposure images. 6.2. Training SVM Classifier For this study, artificial drifts, i.e., overheating drift due to overhang and lack of fusion in the parts with",
        "special geometrical features (see Fig. 6) and by the varying process, were created. The careful selection of the layers from the build parts (81 parts) and labeling it as 'Drift' and 'No-drift' was performed by",
        "analyzing the layers in the MPM software provided by the SLM solutions and statistical analysis. For our study, we have chosen the mean and median of each layer as the input features. As we know, the mean",
        "and median measures the data'scentral tendency and gives us information regarding the data's skewness. Median is an important feature when the data has extreme values. It is also important to mention that other features such as standard deviation and root mean square for each layer were also studied. Still,",
        "SVM results were not satisfactory compared to mean and median. The drawback of choosing two points as thei features per layer is that it compresses the whole layer data into two issues. Therefore, in the study,",
        "individual hotspots' exact location in a particular layer is not studied. A balanced labeled dataset of 170 data points, which comprises an equal number of \"drift\" and \"no-drift\" data points SO that the biasing of the SVM model can be avoided, was prepared.",
        "The best-fitting parameters are to be selected for the SVM classifier to increase the classifier's success rate. A Bayesian optimization algorithm was used to find the best-suited hyperparameters for the model. A hyperparameter is an internal parameter of an algorithm that needs to be optimized. For example, in",
        "our case (SVM model), the box constraint, kernel-function, and kernel-scale are the hyperparameters. These parameters can significantly influence the performance of the algorithm. Thus, optimization of the hyperparameters is advisable. However, optimization is difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, Bayesian",

Results: Case Study",
        "Our study performed the analysis on a so-called \"Benchmark Part,\" used as a benchmark tool in material development in AM. Finding the best fit process parameters is a time-consuming and costly step based",
        "on trial and error methods. Therefore, specific designs are used as a benchmark tool to find the best process parameters such as critical overhang angle, process settings (Laser Power, Hatch distance, Layer Thickness), border thickness, etc. Knowledge of this angle is essential to position the supports correctly.",
        "Indeed, as we know, the critical overhang angle for Al alloys is 30°, SO we can conclude that the benchmark part is prone to failure at some point due to the absence of supports below a critical overhang angle [38].",
        "Another important reason to choose this model as our case study part was that the part's failure could be confirmed via visual inspection without using costly computer tomography techniques. It is then used to",
        "test the accuracy of our trained CNN model and SVM classifier.

Conclusion Despite technological advancement in L-PBF systems over the last decade, the process's reliability and repeatability are a significant challenge due to uncertainties related to defects in the final parts. These",
        "defects can have a detrimental effect on the building part's performance, such as small porosities that can significantly degrade the final part's fatigue properties. The need for monitoring the process at each step",
        "is inevitable for building confidence about the final quality of the part. There are very few studies that have been focused on interlinking or monitoring the process at different steps. Our study aims to monitor and post-process the in-situ data obtained at three different steps, i.e., Pre and",
        "Post-Exposure, and during exposure. Pre and Post-Exposure images capture critical information regarding the powder-bed spreading and printed layer quality. Therefore, both images were treated in an automated fashion using CNN models to detect the anomalies such as Part-Hopping/Part-Overheating: Recoater-Streaking: and \"Uneven Powder Spreading.\" The scale variant of discussed anomalies is",
        "considered, and three different scales (20*20 px2,75*75 px?, 150*150 px?) for each anomaly were chosen. Similarly, the Melt Pool Monitoring data were analyzed using the SVM classifier to classify the layers into \"Drift\" and \"No-Drift.\" \" As the two photodiodes have different spatial detection limits, it was observed that",
        "photodiode 2 captures the drift occurring due to the presence of hotspots much efficiently than photodiode 1. A case study on \"Benchmark Part\" was done to check the proposed CNN model and SVM classifier's accuracy. It was noticed that algorithms successfully predict the above discusses anomalies for both cases.",
        "The full potential of the installed in-situ monitoring devices can only be realized by developing a closed- loop feedback control system by inter-linking the individual signals from each process step. It will help to improve the overall quality assurance oft the building part. 9. Acknowledgments",
