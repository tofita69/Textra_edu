        "In physics in general and in engineering in particular, when addressing a generic problem, the first step consists in selecting the best suited model for the description of the evolution of the system under consideration. Nowadays, a variety",
        "of models exists that are well established and validated, covering most of the domains of physics, e.g., solid and fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, heat transfer... These models are based on the combination of two types of equations of very different nature. From one side, the",
        "so-called balance equations, whose validity in the framework of classical physics is out of discussion. The second type of equations are the so-called constitutive models. These relate primal variables and dual variables, e.g., stress and strain,",
        "temperature and heat flux. Their expression and validity depend on the nature of the considered system and the applied loading-in the most general sense. Corresponding author.

        "(F. Chinesta), mindkeuminpeidouainhe (R. Keunings). Constitutive equations are often phenomenological, and in general involve some parameters assumed to be intrinsic to the system under consideration. For this reason, and even in the context of classical engineering, before solving a given problem, one must decide on the",
        "most appropriate model. There obviously exists a risk on the pertinence of the chosen model for addressing the phenomena under study. By performing some engineered experiments in order to calibrate the model, that is, to extract the value of the parameters that it involves, these risks can be alleviated.",
        "The calibrated model is expressed generally as a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations and must be solved for given loading and boundary conditions. Very often, the solution of these problems is not tractable by an analytical procedure. Numerical methods were intro-",
        "duced in the twentieth century for that purpose, and are nowadays widely employed, in industry as well as in academia. Thus, approximate procedures were proposed, most of them computationally manipulable. The first option consists in as-",

        "and where, for ensuring accuracy, a sufficient number of terms must be considered, implying a quite large number of terms in the finite sum (2). In order to better adapt to complex domains, global functions P;(x) are often replaced by compactly supported functions",

        "the discrete system that results from introducing approximation (3) into the weak form of the problem (for the sake of simplicity assumed to be linear) leads to the linear system KU=F (4)",
        "Here, matrix K represents the discrete form of the model, whereas vectors U and F contain the nodal unknowns and loads, respectively. Their respective sizes are N x N, N x 1 and N x 1. 1.1. Reduced modelling",
        "In many applications of practical interest, despite the richness of Eq. (4) that is able to consider any choice of the loading in a vector space of dimension N, usual loadings contain in practice many correlations. This results in the solution U being",
        "defined in a subspace of dimension n, with n < N. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition proceeds by embedding the solution onto that subspace of dimension n [1] [2] [3] [4). Nonlinear manifold learning constitutes its nonlinear counterpart. For that purpose, from a set of snapshots of the solution",

        "in the reduced basis), it results (BTKB)y =BTF (7) whose respective sizes are n x n, n x 1 and n x 1. In the nonlinear case, different procedures have been proposed for alleviating the construction of K. Among them, one",

It was then extended for addressing space separation [12] or parametric solutions [13] [14] [15] [16] in some of our numerous previous works. Thus, the space-time separated representation now reads",

        "reduced algebraic system can easily be inverted, leading to the reduced transfer function (BTKB) 1. Note that the reduced model matrix (BTKB) does not depend explicitly on the loading. Thus, as soon as a new loading F comes into play, it is",
        "to be projected on the reduced basis BTF = f. Then, the reduced solution is obtained from y = (BTKB) 'f. To recover the solution in the original finite element basis, one simply has to perform the projection U = By.",
        "PGD, on the contrary, does not compute such a reduced model (or its transfer function counterpart), but instead it proceeds by either (i) calculating the solution for each loading, or (ii) expressing the loading in an reduced basis (e.g., POD) according to f(x,t)=X MiFi(x,t) (9) i-1",
        "that allows transforming the initial problem into a parametric one. Within the PGD rationale, the solution is searched in the parametric form u(x, t, N), with = (p1, PF). A criticism that is usually attributed to the PGD technique, if compared to POD-based procedures, is precisely the neces-",
        "sity of the load to be representable in terms of the reduced basis Fi, FF. However, it is important to note that even if such a constraint is less explicit when using the POD rationale, it also applies implicitly [17). Thus, it is important to note",
        "that the POD rationale is based on the existence of a reduced basis B, and that this basis was constructed from a particular choice of snapshots U1, Us, associated with a particular loading F1, Fs. Thus, if a quite different loading comes into",
        "play-one whose solution cannot be accurately approximated by the reduced basis Ri involved in B-the transfer func- tion can be applied, but nothing guarantees the accuracy of the resulting solution. Finally, the applicability of Model Order Reduction techniques remains subordinate to the fulfillment of the conditions assumed during their construction.",
        "All the just discussed techniques belong to the vast family of Model Order Reduction techniques. In fact, models were not really reduced, only the solution procedure. 1.2. Learning models We argued in some of our former works that, in some circumstances, models are too uncertain to represent the physical",
        "system [18). In that case, a data-driven procedure becomes an appealing choice [19] [20] [21] [22). For the sake of simplicity, we assume the problem to be linear and that N couples (Ui, Fi)-assumed independent, that is, spanning the whole vector",
        "space of dimension N-are available. We also assume that nothing is known on the model whose discrete expression consists of the matrix K. Thus, with all the couples fulfilling the algebraic relationship KU; = Fi, Vi (10)",
        "one could construct the vector K (vector expression of the matrix K), the extended loading vector F that includes all the loads, i.e. FT = (F1, FN) and finally matrix U from the different U; organized in an adequate manner SO as to enable Eqs. (10) to be expressed as",

        "learning (based on neural networks, NN), dynamic mode decomposition, DMD... to cite but a few. It is important to note that the complexity of standard solutions involving known models K, scales with the number",
        "of unknowns N, however, when trying to identify the model the complexity scales with N2 (number of component of K), justifying that a lot of data is mandatory for extracting the hidden model, situation that becomes even more stringent in",
        "the nonlinear case that requires identifying a model Klu around any possible value of U. This apparent complexity justifies the fact of associating the term big-data to machine learning. However, in engineering, the available data is in some circumstances very scarce: collecting data could be technologically challenging, sometimes",
        "simply impossible, and in all cases, generally expensive. Thus, the big-data is being, or should be, transformed in a smarter counterpart, with smart-data paradigm rationalizing the amount of needed data, while driving its acquisition (collection): which data, where and when?",
        "The present work tries to exploit the fact previously discussed, that despite the richness of loadings and responses (being the model the application that relates both), in general both are living in low-dimensional manifolds, and therefore",
        "the model relating both is expected to reflect this fact. This consideration was exploited when proposing the so-called hyper-reduction techniques, however they were applied on pre-assumed models, whereas in what follows we apply it while assuming the model unknown.",
        "After this introduction, the next section proposes a procedure for extracting the reduced model from a small amount of data, then the procedure will be illustrated from the analysis of a quite simple nonlinear problem, before finishing by addressing some general conclusions. 2. Methods",
        "For the sake of simplicity, we start by assuming the discrete linear problem KU=F (12) where F and U represent the input and output vectors respectively. In a general case, they could have different nature and",
        "represent the values of their respective fields at the observation points. The respective sizes are N x 1 and N x 1. As in the case of reduced-order modeling, we assume that inputs and outputs are (to a certain degree of approximation)",
        "living in a sub-space of dimension n, much smaller than N. Thus, the rank of K is expected to be also n, even if a priori, it was ready to operate in a larger space of dimension N.",
        "The question is therefore how to extract the reduced model? Among the numerous possibilities we explored, we com- ment here on two of them. 2.1. Rank-n constructor Here, we consider a set of S input-output couples (F;, U:), and assume the model to be expressible from its low-rank form KLR",
        "K & KIR- ZÇeR-2GR (13) j=1 j=1 where @ denotes the tensor product, and Ç and R; are the so-called column and row vectors. This expression is somehow similar to the separated representation used in the PGD, the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) or the CUR decomposition [23] [24).",
        "Remark 1. If the model is expected to be symmetric, one could enforce that symmetry in the solution representation, i.e. K: & KLR (CRI + R;C) (14) = Let us define the functional E(KLR) according to EK-)=IF- K'RUp (15) i-1",
        "The choice of many different norms could be envisaged here. For exploiting sparsity, for instance, the choice should be the L1-norm. In what follows, we consider the standard L2-norm, i.e. we take p = 2.",
        "By considering matrices F and U containing in their columns vectors Fi and Ui respectively, the previous expression can be rewritten using the Frobenius norm (related to P = 2) as EC-)-F-K\"Ul, (16) whose minimization results in K-(UU)=FUT (17) or, equivalently, KLR - (FUT)(UUT)- (18)",
        "This proves that KLR and, more particularly, its column and row vectors, correspond to the SVD (or rank-n truncated SVD) decomposition of (FUT)(UU)\". Remark 2. Within the standard PGD rationale, one could compute the separated representation of KLR by computing pro-",

        "This procedure is specially suitable when N becomes large, thus making difficult the calculation of the SVD decomposition of (FUT)(UUT)- Remark 3. This procedure ensures that when addressing a linear problem, N linearly independent loadings Fj, j=1,.,N,",
        "ensure the construction of a rank-N model K. If the model is computed by incorporating progressively the available data- from one loading leading to model K1 (a single data model), to N leading to KN_we can define the model enrichment AK = Ki - K = 2, N.",
        "Note that adding more data, Fj, j > N, to the model does not make it evolve anymore, as expected. In other words: KI =K, J > N. In the nonlinear case, where a model is a priori expected to exist around each U, the model continues to",
        "evolve when j > N. With the low-rank model thus calculated, as soon as a new datum arrives, F, the solution is evaluated from U=( (KLR)-'F (21) Remark 4. In section 2.3 we propose an alternative methodology based on the calculation of transfer functions that avoids model inversion.",
        "2.2. Progressive greedy construction In this case we proceed progressively. We consider the first available datum, the pair (F1, U1). Thus, the first, one-rank, reduced model reads K1 = (CR) (22) ensuring (CR)U1 = F1 (23)",
        "and one possible solution, ensuring symmetry, consists of R1 = F1 and C1 = E with Pi = FU,. Many other solutions exist, since there are N available data for computing 2N unknowns (the components of the row and column vectors). Of course,",
        "the problem can be written as a minimization problem using an adequate norm. Suppose now that a second datum arrives, (F2, U2), from which we can also compute its associated rank-one approxima- tion, and SO on, for any new datum (Fi, U;). This leads to Ki = (GR) (24)",
        "ensuring at its turn (CR)U; = Fi (25) where Ci = F gi (with i = F/Ui) and Ri = Fi. For any other U, the model could be interpolated from the just defined rank-one models, Ki,i=1,. S, according to S Klu & KI(U) (26) i-1",
        "with I(U) the interpolation functions operating in the space of the data U. This constructor is not appropriate when addressing linear behaviors. If we assume known two local rank-one behaviors",
        "K1 and K2 ensuring the fulfillment of relations K,Ui = F1 and K2U2 = F2, it follows that if for example F= 0.5(F1 + F2), by considering K = 0.5(K1 + K2), the resulting output does not satisfy linearity, i.e. U * 0.5(U1 + U2).",
        "However, in the nonlinear case, by defining the secant behavior at the middle point associated with F = 0.5(F1 + F2) as N = 0.5(K2 - K1), we will have K = K1 + K = 0.5(K1 + K2), fact that allows viewing the progressive greedy construction",
        "and its associated interpolation as a linearization procedure. 2.3. General remarks All the previous analysis was based on the calculation of the reduced model KLR. However, this procedure needs its inversion KLR-' for evaluating the solution U = KLR-'F. This issue could be easily circumvented as follows.",
        "The discrete model KU = F can be rewritten as U = K IF and by introducing the discrete transfer function T (that represents the inverse of K), one could learn directly, by using all the previous rationale, the reduced expression of the transfer function, i.e. TLR.",
        "The advantage of learning the reduced discrete transfer function is that, as soon as a datum F is available-and under the assumption that it is living in the same subspace that served for constructing the reduced model-the evaluation",
        "becomes straightforward: a simple matrix-vector product. It can even be more simplified, since matrix TLR is expressed in a separate format, U = TLRF, with T & TLR Z,Ry (27) j=1",
        "Nothing really changes when considering nonlinear models, except the fact that the models, K or T and, in turn, the vectors they involve, must be assigned to the neighborhood of the data U or F. In practice, data can be classified,",
        "creating a number clusters where the models are constructed [25]. Thus, each time a datum F arrives, the cluster to which it belongs-say, K-is first identified. Then, the low-rank discrete transfer functions of that cluster, TIR, is chosen and the solution evaluated according to U=TIRF (28)",
        "Again within the PGD rationale, all the discussion above can be extended to parametric settings. The description and results constitute a work in progress that will be reported in ongoing publications. Another work in progress concerns",
        "the obtention of error bounds, needed for certifying the constructed models and their predictions. There is a vast corps of literature on verification and validation, but they where associated with model-based simulations. Here, for the best",
        "identified model, the existing error estimation procedures can be applied. However, the remaining question concerns the estimation of the error associated with the model itself, whose quality depends on the collected data, i.e. validation,",
        "more than verification. This issue also applies in model-based simulations: how to be sure that the considered models are the appropriate ones? 50 40 - 30 20 10 0 -10 -20 -30 -40 -50 -50 0 50 Fig. 1. Domain equipped with a finite-element mesh.",
        "Despite the apparent difficulty, since the model is defined with the only support of a discrete basis, some estimators could be easily defined, and will be reported in future works. All the previous developments could be accomplished by first extracting the reduced bases associated with input and",
        "output vectors (action and reaction) and then learning the associated reduced models within the framework of a pro- gressive POD. However, the procedure here considered seems more physically sound. A fully reduced counterpart of",
        "the procedures here proposed and described constitutes a work in progress, whose results will be reported in ongoing publications. The present procedure becomes quite close to the so-called dynamic model decomposition as soon as the model is",
        "assumed to be expressed in a tensor form and extended to nonlinear settings from an appropriate clustering. The main issue when considering data-driven models is the noise impact on the predictions. There are many possi-",
        "bilities, most of them based on the use of filters. Here, we considered, as proved later, a simple procedure. The data (F, Ui) is obtained with a resolution N, on which noise applies. A quite efficient filter consists in simply consider-",
        "ing the model, i.e. its row and column vectors, described with a coarser resolution M < N. In fact, inputs and outputs could exhibit fast fluctuations, but in many applications, in which model order reduction applies, these fast fluctuations",
        "are almost due to noise, and for that reason, the model could be expected being described with a coarser resolu- tion. 3. Results 3.1. A nonlinear example In order to prove the potential interest of the methodology here described, we consider a nonlinear elastic model with",
        "Poisson coefficient and Young's modulus given by respectively by V= 0.3 and E = 105(1 + 1000E1), with E1I the second invariant of the strain tensor E. Units are MPa for stresses, N/mm for applied tractions and mm for lengths.",
