It is in good agreement with data collected from conventional casting, directed energy deposition, and powder bed fusion processes. 1 Introduction",
        "Austenitic stainless steels, in particular 316L, have attracted wide attention in additive manufacturing (AM) because of their utilization in a large variety of applications and their corrosion resistance. AM of 316L parts is mainly performed either by directed energy deposition, primarily using a laser, e.g., the",
        "laser metal deposition process (LMD), or by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Both techniques result in a hierarchical microstructure with physical and chemical heterogeneities across multiple length scales. 1 Sub-micron sized oxide (i.e., MnSiO3, SiO2, and CrMn204) [1-5] and non-oxide (i.e., sulfide such",
        "as Mns) [4,5] precipitates are among the smallest chemical and physical heterogeneities present in any as-built 316L. These precipitates play an important role in determining the mean free path of dislocations and may contribute to an increase in the yield strength of the material [1,2,6,7. They can also act as",
        "nucleation sites for cracks [8] and have deleterious effects on the corrosion resistance of 316L [9). One of the main contributors to the formation of oxide precipitates in AM 316L is the oxygen in- troduced into the solid-solution of the alloy during the gas atomization process used to manufacture the",
        "powder feedstock [3). Another contributor is the oxygen induced into the material from the environment during the AM process and the amount added depends on the AM process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, and shielding gas flow rate [1,10,11]. Oxide precipitates formed during the gas atomization",
        "process can persist in the liquid phase during AM [3), and new oxides can nucleate and grow during the rapid solidification phase of an AM process as shown via mean field nucleation and growth models [7.",
        "Along with the oxides, non-oxide precipitates can also nucleate and grow during solidification, often in the vicinity of the oxides [4,12). After building, AM parts are often heat-treated to obtain desired mechanical properties and reduce residual stresses. The evolution of these precipitates (oxide and non-oxides) was investigated during",
        "annealing treatments 2, 5, 6, 13J by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively). The results show coarsening and phase transformations of these precipitates to more stable precipitates. In addition to these observations, faster coarsening kinetics of oxides were observed at the",
        "early stage of recrystallization due to grain boundary diffusion [5] accompanied by the following effects of the recrystallization on phase transformation [5): MnSiO3 to CrMn204 for non-recrystalized grains and MnSiO3 to Si-rich oxides in recrystallized grains.",
        "However, the impact of an important part of the AM process on the formation of precipitates has not yet been well studied. This part is the long period after solidification and until the end of the process",
        "during which the material is subjected to multiple heating and cooling cycles at different temperature amplitudes (up to the solidus) and heating and cooling rates (up to 103-106 oC/s) in the solid state, which",
        "is called solid-state thermal cycling (SSTC) or intrinsic heat treatment. Thus far, only one study [41 has reported on the effect of SSTC on precipitate evolution. In this study, TEM lamellae were subjected to SSTC inside a TEM and the precipitate composition evolution before and after each SSTC was compared.",
        "While such studies are well suited to understand precipitate composition evolution, it is not possible to conclude on precipitate volume fraction, density, and size evolution during SSTC because of the thin sample geometry and the limited number of precipitates studied.",
        "To that end, in this work, a novel experimental procedure is proposed. It involves subjecting micropil- lars extracted from AM 316L to SSTCS in a controlled environment (vacuum) and measuring precipitate evolution in them by performing nanotomography using transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), before",
        "and after each SSTC. The micropillars are 25 um in diameter and 75 pm in height, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than TEM lamellae and hence, more representative; thus, TXM studies",
        "on micropillars are better suited to study the volume fraction, density, and size evolution of precipitates in AM 316L than TEM studies on thin-film lamellae. The nature of the SSTCS performed on the mi-",

        "Material composition, AM process parameters, experimental techniques, and setups used in the present work have been already presented in our previous works [4,12, 14]. Thus, only a brief recapitulation of the material and methods is provided here. 2.1 Material and sample preparation",
        "A 316L powder produced via inert gas atomization was investigated. The chemical composition of the powder is (wt%): Fe16.9C-127N-25Mel3Mln0rs-0015P-00IIC.0.005S: oxygen up to 0.05 % may be added to the powder during atomization. A single track bidirectionally printed wall of 3 layers",

        "vertical displacement of focusing head = 0.2 mm between each layer. This wall is the same as the one used in [4, 12,14). After cutting (normal to the build and print directions) and polishing (Sic paper up to 4000 grit,",
        "followed by 3 pm and 1 pm grit diamond paste, and finally Ar ion polishing), the as-built wall was characterized by SEM and electron back-scattered diffraction (Oxford Instruments) analysis using an environmental-SEM Quanta 650 FEG microscope; the images can be found in [4,12). Regions of interest",
        "close to the center of the wall thickness in the first, second, and third layer were defined and cylindrical micropillars of 2 25 m diameter and 2 75 um height were extracted from these regions using a focused",
        "ion beam (FIB) inside a FEI Helios Nanolab 660 dualbeam SEM-FIB. To reduce the time to manufacture micropillars, a 30 kV high voltage and a 65 nA beam current have been used to mill the surrounding",

        "To perform SSTC, each micropillar was attached to a thermal chip (Figure 1c), which can be mounted onto a thermal chip holder (Fusion Select Protochips) developed for TEM. The holder can heat the chip",
        "from room temperature (RT) to a maximum of 1200 °C and cool it back down to RT, with maximum heating and cooling rates of 106 °C/s. A FEI Titan3 G2 60-300 TEM was used with this holder to perform SSTC in primary vacuum (at about 10-8 mbar).",
        "This setup to perform SSTC on micropillars has the following advantages: (i) the primary vacuum inside the TEM ensures that the micropillar is not oxidized during SSTC, (ii) the thermal chip has been benchmarked (by Protochips) for temperature amplitude and heating and cooling rates mentioned above,",
        "and (iii) the micropillars are uniformly heated and cooled everywhere, which has been confirmed via FE based heat transfer simulations described in Section 2.3 and presented in Section 3.1. 2.3 Heat transfer simulation setup The electrothermal chips used to perform SSTC have been designed to uniformly heat and cool TEM",
        "lamellae, which have a typical surface area of 2 5 X 5 pm2 and thickness of 2 0.1 pm. However, it is not sure whether the chip can uniformly heat (cool) micropillars of diameter 25 pm and height 75 um up to 3",
        "the maximum temperature at the highest heating (cooling) rate. To gain insight on this aspect, transient heat transfer FE simulations were performed. During the experiment, each micropillar had been placed in such a way that one of its circular surfaces",
        "was in contact with the chip and they were held in place using three \"+\"-shaped tungsten contacts (see Figure 1c). The micropillars were heated via their contact with the chip through the tungsten contacts",
        "and via radiative heat transfer from the chip. However, in the simulations, we assume the most adverse scenario, which is that the micropillars are only heated via the \"+\"-shaped contacts; this assumption results in the highest temperature gradients. It is further assumed that these tungsten contacts conduct",
        "heat perfectly from the chip to the micropillar i.e., at any given instant, the tungsten contacts have the same temperature as the chip. Even further, it is assumed that the portion of each of these tungsten",
        "contacts at the bottom of the curved surface of the micropillar is a square of size 6 X 6 pm2 with negligible thickness. Two contacts are placed at 180° with respect to each other and the third one is at 90° to the",
        "other two about the micropillar axis (see Figure 2). In the simulation, the tungsten contacts are: mimicked by imposing temperature (Dirichlet) boundary condition at their location. The remainder of the curved surface and the flat surfaces are imposed with zero heat flux (Neumann) boundary condition. The initial,",
        "ambient, and reference temperatures are all set to 20 oC. Since radiation and other heat sources and sinks are neglected, the governing equation to be solved is: pci = KAT (1) where T is the temperature, P = P(T), Cy = C(T), and k = K(T) are the temperature dependent",
        "density, specific heat at constant volume, and thermal conductivity, respectively, as shown below. The heat conduction is assumed to be isotropic and any spatial variation in k is assumed to be negligible in",
        "comparison to spatial variations in T. The temperature dependency of P, Cus and k for 316L are given by [15): C(T) = 458.98 + 0.1328 T J/(kg.K) P(T) = 8084.2 - 0.4208 T - 3.8942 X 10 -5 T2 kg/m (2) K(T) = 9.248 + 0.0157 T W/(m.K)",

        "a 2 X 2 binning). While the field-of-view was sufficiently larger than the diameter of the micropillars, it was however insufficient to cover their height. To that end, three measurements along the height of the micropillars were necessary. For each measurement, 1000 projections of 1 S exposure time each",
        "were acquired at RT over an angular range of 180° to guarantee the best spatial resolution possible during the reconstruction and a good signal-to-noise ratio. A resolution of 81 nm, i.e., the minimum precipitate diameter that can be measured, was achieved with the current setup and analysis workflow",

These observations contradict our initial expectation about precipitate evolution and previous works on heat-treatment of an additively manufactured 316L [2,5,6,22). For a fixed alloy",
        "composition and temperature during a thermal treatment, and in absence of precipitation of other phases, f should tend to its equilibrium value. Assuming that oxygen content is the limiting factor, the fraction of oxide precipitates at equilibrium with austenite is given by: alloy (4)",

        "After oxide precipitation due to SSTC, ab < 1 due to the very low soluble-oxygen content of austenite. Then, fP can be approximated as: L alloy fP (5) L 0 The decrease in fP can occur either by increasing the amount of oxygen of the precipitate by solid",
        "phase transformation or by decreasing the average oxygen content of investigated steel or both. The two approaches are independently discussed in the following. 4.1 Phase transformation to a more stable precipitate",
        "After annealing at high temperature (T = 1065 C and 1150 oC) during 2 hours, Deng et al. [5] reported the evolution of MnSiO3 to CrMn204 in non-recrystallized grains and the evolution of MnSiO3 to Si-rich precipitates in recrystallized grains. Evolution towards richer Si and Cr-Mn precipitates is also observed",
        "by [12] after subjecting the sample to SSTCs that could occur during AM. According to the Ellingham diagram, SiO2 by itself is the most stable oxide amongst all possible Mn,Siy0z (x, y N 0, and Z > 0) [33].",
        "However, oxides present in 316L at equilibrium are. highly dependent on the composition [5] and, to a lesser extent, on the temperature in the range investigated [2,5] (650°C to 1100°C). Preferential segregation of Cr and Mo occurs at the interdendritic regions in any as-built 316L microstructure. These segregations",
        "affect the solubility limit between oxides and the matrix, and hence their stability [5). In addition, the equilibrium stability of oxides highly depends on the Si content [2): depending of the Si content the most stable precipitate could be MnSiO3, CrMn204, SiO2, or quartz. Finally, if recrystallization occurs",
        "during the thermal treatments, then it would affect the evolution of MnSiO3 precipitates [5). Due to the metastable nature of any additively manufactured microstructure, evolution towards more stable phases is then expected during annealing of 316L. Assuming the transformation occurs from MnSiO3 to",
        "SiO2, a lower mole fraction of precipitates for a fixed alloy oxygen content is then expected due to the higher molar oxygen content of SiO2 (2/3 at% 0) than MnSiO3 (3/5 at% 0). Conversely, precipitation",
        "of CrMn204 (4/7 at% 0) would result in a higher mole fraction of precipitates for a fixed alloy oxygen content. However, these differences between the oxygen content of precipitates are small and they cannot explain the observed decrease in f and dissolution of precipitates. In addition, the molar volumes of",
        "the oxide precipitates considered are similar and do not result in a strong change in f. These claims are supported by thermodynamic calculations for 316L showing that similar f are observed between the precipitates considered [2,5). 12 4.2 Decrease of the average oxygen content of the steel",
        "Micropillars were heat-treated inside a TEM operating under primary vacuum (n 10-8 mbar). Heat treatments under such an environment can result in the evaporation of elements [34). This phenomenon has been observed in stainless steels annealed at high temperatures with the evaporation of Mn, Cr, Si,",

Due to the decrease in the average oxygen content, oxide dissolution can occur and may be",
        "delayed by the slower diffusion of Mn, Si, and Cr. Evaporation of Cr, Mn, and Si at high temperatures will affect the equilibrium of the investigated steel. Decreasing the Si content of the alloy affects the",

Guided by FE simulations, the highest heating and cooling rates",
        "during these SSTCS were restricted to 1000 oC/s in order to ensure uniform heating or cooling of the micropillar at any given instant. TXM was performed before and after each SSTC in order to characterize",

Coupled with a 3D U-net DCNN model to segment precipitates, the proposed experimental procedure has proven to be a powerful tool to statistically investigate the evolution of precipitates. In this study, more than 80000",
        "precipitates of equivalent diameters lower than 200 nm were investigated. The experimental results show a good agreement between the equivalent average diameter measured via TXM from micropillars in as-built condition and our previous TEM study.",
        "During short SSTC involving heating and cooling rates of 1000 oC/s precipitation was observed, i.e., an increase of the phase fraction and density of precipitate, indicating that oxygen remained supersaturated in solid solution after solidification. However, during long SSTCS and annealing treatments, the fraction,",
        "density, and average diameter of precipitates decreased, indicating their dissolution. This dissolution is caused by the evaporation of elements from the surface of the micropillars into the primary vacuum of the TEM during SSTC. This problem could be reduced by performing e.g., the SSTCS in an inert",
        "environment. Nevertheless, the experimental-modeling-simulation synergy technique developed in this work can be very useful to study precipitate evolution of any alloy in 3D during rapid and slow SSTCs. An empirical relationship between the cooling rate of solidification and precipitate diameter was",
        "proposed. This relationship can complement the relationship between primary cellular arm spacing and cooling rates during solidification in order to predict these rates from the measured precipitate diameters.
