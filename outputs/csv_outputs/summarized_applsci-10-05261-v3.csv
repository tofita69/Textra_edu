One of the last epidemiological studies highlighting the increase of injuries over the past 16 years, has emphasized that muscle incidents were the main cause [2].

Several important performance-related features have been highlighted, such as distances travelled at different speeds, accelerations, decelerations and maximum speed [9]. For instance, the average distance travelled in matches by elite soccer players is of 9 to 12 km [9,10].

For 1-month injury prediction, the classifiers learnt from GPS or questionnaire data show roughly the same performance levels, the best one being usually reached when combining GPS and questionnaire data.

The accuracy of this tree, particularly at 1 week, which differs from Rossi et al.
