AM of 316L parts is mainly performed either by directed energy deposition, primarily using a laser, e.g., the laser metal deposition process (LMD), or by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Both techniques result in","Chunk 13: In this paper, we report on the development and use of additive manufacturing techniques for the production of 316L parts."

They can also act as nucleation sites for cracks [8] and have deleterious effects on the corrosion resistance of 316L [9). One of the main contributors to the formation of oxide precipitates in AM 316L is the oxygen in- troduced into the solid-solution of the alloy during the gas atomization process used to manufacture the powder feedstock [3). Another contributor is the oxygen induced into the material from the environment",Chunk 15: The formation of oxide precipitates in AM 316L can have a number of benefits.

Oxide precipitates formed during the gas atomization process can persist in the liquid phase during AM [3), and new oxides can nucleate and grow during the rapid solidification phase of an AM process as shown via mean field nucleation and growth models [7.

The evolution of these precipitates (oxide and non-oxides) was investigated during annealing treatments 2, 5, 6, 13J by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively). The results show coarsening and phase transformations of these precipitates to more stable",Chunk 17: The evolution of oxide and non-oxide precipitates during annealing at temperatures up to 13J has been investigated.

In addition to these observations, faster coarsening kinetics of oxides were observed at the early stage of recrystallization due to grain boundary diffusion [5] accompanied by the following effects of the recrystallization on phase transformation [5): MnSiO3 to CrMn204 for non-recrystalized grains and MnSiO3 to Si-rich oxides in recrystallized grains.

The micropillars are 25 um in diameter and 75 pm in height, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than TEM lamellae and hence, more representative; thus, TXM studies on micropillars are better suited to study the volume fraction, density, and size evolution of precipitates",Chunk 21: The morphology of precipitates extracted from AM 316L and SSTCS has been compared with that of lamellae.

Evaporation of Cr, Mn, and Si at high temperatures will affect the equilibrium of the investigated steel. Decreasing the Si content of the alloy affects the precipitates present at equilibrium (e.g., reducing the Si content from 4 to 0 wt% in a 316L alloy at 700 oC leads to the transformation of precipitates from Quartz to MnSi03, and then to CrMnO4 [5]),","Chunk 152: The equilibrium of Cr, Mn, and Si in a 316L alloy at 700 oC has been investigated."
153,"but the phase fraction of the precipitates remains similar as discussed before and reported by [5). Similar results can be expected for Cr and Mn. 13 One possibility to reduce or prevent the evaporation of oxygen is to perform SSTCS in an inert environment. However, performing these type of tests requires special setups e.g., sealed gas holders,",Chunk 153: The evaporation of oxygen during SSTCS has been reported in a number of experiments.

Micropillars were extracted from as-built LMD 316L samples and subjected to different controlled SSTCS inside the TEM that mimicked additional heating and cooling of the material that could occur during AM or post-process annealing. Guided by FE simulations, the highest heating and cooling rates during these SSTCS were restricted to 1000 oC/s in order to ensure uniform heating or cooling of the","Chunk 155: In this study, we have investigated the effects of surface temperature control (SSTC) during atomic force microscopy (AFM) on the microstructure of a 316L"

Coupled with a 3D U-net DCNN model to segment precipitates, the proposed experimental procedure has proven to be a powerful tool to statistically investigate the evolution of precipitates. In this study, more than 80000 precipitates of equivalent diameters lower than 200 nm were investigated. The experimental results show",Chunk 156: The evolution of precipitates in micropillars has been investigated using time-lapse microscopy (TXM) in order to track the evolution of precipitates in the micropillars following a

During short SSTC involving heating and cooling rates of 1000 oC/s precipitation was observed, i.e., an increase of the phase fraction and density of precipitate, indicating that oxygen remained supersaturated in solid solution after solidification. However, during long SSTCS and annealing treatments, the fraction,",Chunk 157: The phase fraction and density of precipitate have been investigated during short and long solid state treatment experiments (SSTCS and annealing).
158,"density, and average diameter of precipitates decreased, indicating their dissolution. This dissolution is caused by the evaporation of elements from the surface of the micropillars into the primary vacuum of the TEM during SSTC. This problem could be reduced by performing e.g., the SSTCS in an inert environment. Nevertheless, the experimental-modeling-simulation synergy technique developed in this work can be very useful to study precipitate evolution of any alloy in 3D during rapid and slow SSTCs.",Chunk 158: The evolution of precipitates in a three-dimensional (3D) superconducting material (SSTCS) has been investigated using a Time-resolved Electron Microscopy (
