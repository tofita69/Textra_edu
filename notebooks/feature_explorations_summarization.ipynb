    "For modelling, I perform both extractive and abstractive summarization. For extractive summarization, I use the BERT transformer model and customize it to use the pre-trained weights of the **`sciBERT`** model which specializes in scientific texts, which fit our purpose. For every text, I determine the optimal number of sentences for the extracted summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For abstractive summarization, I first concatenate the abstract, extractive summary, and conclusion together since much of the important information can be found in them. Then, I use the **`facebook-BART-large-cnn`** transformer model to perform the abstraction.\n",
